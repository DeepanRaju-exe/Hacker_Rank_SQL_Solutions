Its a very good question that i came across in haker rank challenging one loved solving it.

#
Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by each student. Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order. If more than one student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id. If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created, then exclude those students from the result.

Approach

1.Creating CTE "CTE" To get the challenges created by each hacker_id

2.Creating CTE "R" To group it

3.Creating CTE "Q" to get the number of hacker who ceated same number of challenges

4.Now comes the solution part As per question the people who solved same number of problems and its less than maximum should be excluded

5.Then union iot with the all people who solved the max number of problems. Then order it with descending order of questions created and conflict resolved by taking min hacker id
