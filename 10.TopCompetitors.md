Julia just finished conducting a coding contest, and she needs your help assembling the leaderboard! Write a query to print the respective hacker_id and name of hackers who achieved full scores for more than one challenge. Order your output in descending order by the total number of challenges in which the hacker earned a full score. If more than one hacker received full scores in same number of challenges, then sort them by ascending hacker_id.

##
Hackers: The hacker_id is the id of the hacker, and name is the name of the
Difficulty: The difficult_level is the level of difficulty of the challenge, and score is the score of the challenge for the difficulty level.
Challenges: The challenge_id is the id of the challenge, the hacker_id is the id of the hacker who created the challenge, and difficulty_level is the level of difficulty
Submissions: The submission_id is the id of the submission, hacker_id is the id of the hacker who made the submission, challenge_id is the id of the challenge that the submission belongs to, and score is the score of the submission.

#
Approach:

1.Creating CTE with joining all required Tables and filtering oiut it by full score and challenge id

2.With That CTE Self join it 

3.Counting the challenges they have done and filter which has more than 1.

4.Group it with hackerid and name for the same.

5.Extracting the name and id and ordering as per requirement.

6.It has another approach as well i have mentioned it in solutions
