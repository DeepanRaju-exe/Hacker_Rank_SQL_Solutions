#
Samantha interviews many candidates from different colleges using coding challenges and contests. Write a query to print the contest_id, hacker_id, name, and the sums of total_submissions, total_accepted_submissions, total_views, and total_unique_views for each contest sorted by contest_id. Exclude the contest from the result if all four sums are .
Note: A specific contest can be used to screen candidates at more than one college, but each college only holds  screening contest.

##
Input Format
The following tables hold interview data:
Contests: The contest_id is the id of the contest, hacker_id is the id of the hacker who created the contest, and name is the name of the hack

Colleges: The college_id is the id of the college, and contest_id is the id of the contest that Samantha used to screen the candidates.

Challenges: The challenge_id is the id of the challenge that belongs to one of the contests whose contest_id Samantha forgot, and college_id is the id of the college where the challenge was given to candidates

View_Stats: The challenge_id is the id of the challenge, total_views is the number of times the challenge was viewed by candidates, and total_unique_views is the number of times the challenge was viewed by unique candidates.

Submission_Stats: The challenge_id is the id of the challenge, total_submissions is the number of submissions for the challenge, and total_accepted_submission is the number of submissions that achieved full scores.

#Approach:

1.Creating CTE ch_views to get the total views and unique views

2.Creating CTE sub_stat to get the total submissions and accepted submissions

3.All Based on contest_id grouping

4.Now joining these two cte with contest table to make the desired output.
