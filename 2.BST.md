#You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.

##Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:

##Root: If node is root node.
##Leaf: If node is leaf node.
##Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.

#My Approach:

1.Filtering out the inner  node first by creating a CTE
2.Using join => condition of inner node is it should have a parent and a child 
3.Hence taken three tables and joined to make it .
4.Now with inner nodes using case statement distinguished the node types.
