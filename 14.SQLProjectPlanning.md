#
You are given a table, Projects, containing three columns: Task_ID, Start_Date and End_Date. It is guaranteed that the difference between the End_Date and the Start_Date is equal to 1 day for each row in the table.
If the End_Date of the tasks are consecutive, then they are part of the same project. Samantha is interested in finding the total number of different projects completed.

##
Write a query to output the start and end dates of projects listed by the number of days it took to complete the project in ascending order. If there is more than one project that have the same number of completion days, then order by the start date of the project.

Approach

1.Its a nice question we need to find the start and end date of projects and order them by Ascending of completion days and conflicts resolved by start_date ASC

2.If you see the data you will find that start date will not be the end date of anyother project. so we get the start date of project by this in CTE "project_start"

3.Like wise for end date it will not be the start date of other projects.if its then it belong to same project. So by this we get end date in cte "Project_end"

4.i have used rownumber which will be used to get desired outputs while joining both cte.

5.Join both cte and order them by datediff and start date.
