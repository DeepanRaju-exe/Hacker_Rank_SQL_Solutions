##
Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.
Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1.

Approach:

1.Creating CTE "C" with non identical pairs like (12,12) other than this, we are going to find the matching pairs as per question.

2.In "C" there will be repiation like 13,7 and 7,13 but we have to treat these two as same.Hence we use least and greatest to achieve that.

3.Now half work is done now we have to find the matching pairs in identical one for thagt union union we do that.
