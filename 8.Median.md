#
We have to Calculate the Median of Northen Latitude.

#
A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to  decimal places.

##
Approach:

1. Creating CTE to lable row number by sorting latitude in ascending.

2. If the max row number that is last value is odd then Taking the middle observation as median.

3. If the max row is evven then taking the middle as median.
