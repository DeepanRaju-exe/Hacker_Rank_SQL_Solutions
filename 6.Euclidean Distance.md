#
We have to find the Euclidean Distance between two points

##
Consider  and  to be two points on a 2D plane where  are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and  are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.
Query the Euclidean Distance between points  and  and format your answer to display  decimal digits.

###
Approach:

1.As per the formula "d =√[(x2 – x1)^2 + (y2 – y1)^2]" 

2.Taking the minimum maximum of latitiude and longtitude

3.Finding the difference and taking square and a square root over the result
